# StartUp 0.3

* New features:

- Added a panel to edit the system and main user blacklists, mainly used to block
  faulty drivers from packages.
- Now there is a quick option to restore all the configurations (that can be
  edited with this application) to their default values. (If the default value
  is to not have a file, it will be deleted).

* Improvements:

- Left-below menu field was converted to a fully featured menu bar. Now its
  options are now easier to select.
- Added an option to navigate application help files. It will look up in
  $(app_dir)/Documentation/index.html


# StartUp 0.2

* New features:

- This release added a preliminar option to edit the kernel load configuration file.
- Unified the User* scripts under a single view and added USS and USFS scripts (these
  two are not currently functional) editors.
- Added initial support for live monitoring for autoupdates, in order to have to
  manually update each time there is an external change.

* Bugfixes:

- A fix for the editor views was tried. Now when it is tried to be opened with
  an external editor, it will open it if it exists and ask for its creation when it does not.

# StartUp 0.1

This is an unstable initial version intended only for testing and previewing.
Although it mostly works, it could contain a number of stability issues that
could make it not useful for end users.

* New features:

- New application written from scratch, using the Haiku API.
- It can create entries in the automatic launch directory in order to launch
  applications at start.
- It can also edit the UserBootscript used for automatic commands at start-up
  as well.
- It can edit the environment related files ~/config/settings/profile and
  ~/config/settings/boot/UserSetupEnvironment in a single application, but also
  allowing the user to open them in their default text editor for source code.

* Miscellaneous:

- Naming: the name "StartUp" does what its name says, it is intended to
  deal with things that have to do with the start of Haiku after the booting
  process.
