# StartUp 0.1

This is an unstable initial version intended only for testing and previewing.
Although it mostly works, it could contain a number of stability issues that
could make it not useful for end users.

* New features:

- New application written from scratch, using the Haiku API.
- It can create entries in the automatic launch directory in order to launch
  applications at start.
- It can also edit the UserBootscript used for automatic commands at start-up
  as well.
- It can edit the environment related files ~/config/settings/profile and
  ~/config/settings/boot/UserSetupEnvironment in a single application, but also
  allowing the user to open them in their default text editor for source code.

* Miscellaneous:

- Naming: the name "StartUp" does what its name says, it is intended to
  deal with things that have to do with the start of Haiku after the booting
  process.
